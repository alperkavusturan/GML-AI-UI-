Title: Generate Motivation Letter with AI

Requirements:
- One page application with a simple navbar/header.
- Two main elements on the page:
	+ Form group for sending request to the backend (see the form items below)
		- Employee Name (text-input)
		- Employee skills (text-area)
		- Job description (text-area)
		- Min and Max character (number-input)
		- Submit button
	+ List group for waiting/processed requests
		- Title (Employee name)
		- Status (Waiting/Done) p.s: you can use status badge etc.
		- Content (if it's done show the content, otherwise you can put a standard message or spinner)

Notes:
- Keep it simple but with a good design perspective
- You can divide the screen into two parts, one for form group and one for list group
- You can use Bootstrap if you wish or plain HTML/CSS
